# -Spotify-Dashboard-using-Power-BI

📌 Introduction

Are you a music lover or a data enthusiast?
This project combines both! 🎶 Using Power BI, I built an interactive Spotify Dashboard that transforms raw Spotify data into meaningful insights — from analyzing personal listening habits to exploring global music trends like the Top 50 World chart.

🚀 With DAX Query View, you can skip writing endless measures manually and instead build a powerful, professional-grade portfolio project.


🔧 Tech Stack

Power BI (Data Modeling & Visualization)

DAX Query View (Measures & Calculations)

Spotify Dataset (CSV format)

📂 Project Workflow
Step 1: Get Your Spotify Data

Export your personal listening history (from Spotify account settings) or

Use a pre-compiled dataset (e.g., Spotify Global Top 50).

Step 2: Import Data into Power BI

Load the CSV dataset into Power BI Desktop.

Perform basic transformations (if needed).

Step 3: Unleash the Power of DAX Query View

Enable DAX Query View in Power BI:

Go to File > Options and settings > Options > Preview features.

Check ✅ DAX query view.

Restart Power BI.

Step 4: Create Visuals in Power BI

Switch to Report View and drag measures to build:

📊 KPI Cards → Total Songs, Distinct Artists, Avg Popularity

📈 Bar Charts → Singles vs. Albums

🍩 Donut Charts → Explicit vs. Non-Explicit Songs

📋 Tables → Top-ranked songs & artists

🏆 Key Insights

How many songs and distinct artists are in the dataset

Popularity trends (average, min, max)

Distribution of explicit vs. clean tracks

Album vs. single breakdown

🎯 Conclusion

This project shows how combining Spotify data + Power BI can create a professional portfolio piece while being fun and insightful.
